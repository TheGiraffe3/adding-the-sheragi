# Adding the Sheragi

This is a plugin for the free, open-source game Endless Sky (endless-sky.github.io).

This plugin re-adds the Sheragi, and uses outfits and ship sprites taken from Petersupes' [Sheragi Rebirth](https://github.com/Petersupes/sheragi-rebirth) plugin (with permission). These Sheragi do not use the Emerald Sword, though they have a less powerful version of it called the Platinum Spear, which does not have a Dragonflame Cannon.
The Sheragi are closer to T1.3, because they focus on _massive_ ships.

This plugin will cause errors unless installed with the [Jibauni](https://github.com/TheGiraffe3/Jibauni) plugin.
